# textbook automation

When you input the subject and the page that you want. The program opens a chrom tab and logs into my textbooks account to subject and page I said.

I have a .txt file with my password and username that I'm not going to share.

I was bored in class and I thought that it would be fun if I made an automation to log in, chose the correct textbook, and go to the page I've set.

I did it using selenium and the chromdriver (version 84). The site of the books is ecasals.net, if you don't have an account you won't be able to try the program, and it won't work for you because you may have different  textbooks.

Thanks!
