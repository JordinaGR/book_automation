# textbook automation

When you input the subject and the page that you want. The program opens a chrome tab and logs into my textbooks account to the subject and page I said.

I have a .txt file with my password and username that I'm not going to share.

I was bored in class some months ago, and I thought that it would be fun if I made an automation to log in, chose the correct textbook, and go to the page I've set.

I did it using selenium and python and the site of the books is ecasals.net.

Thanks!
